## Getting Started

### Install from Logseq Marketplace

- Press [`---`] on the top right toolbar to open [`Plugins`]. Select marketplace. Type `Toolbar` in the search field, select it from the search results and install

### Usage

- Even if this plugin is enabled, the buttons on the toolbar are switched off by default by the Logseq core. Press the ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/103b9a3f-8c25-4e42-903d-c05c71c349db) button on the toolbar to set it to be visible. The user can choose which buttons to display.
- Note: Except for the Undo/Redo button, the icons disappear when no page is open.
