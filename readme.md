## Getting Started

### ~~Install from Logseq Marketplace (Coming👷🚧)~~

- ~~Press [`---`] on the top right toolbar to open [`Plugins`]. Select marketplace. Type `Toolbar` in the search field, select it from the search results and install~~

### Usage

- Even if the plug-in is enabled, the buttons on the toolbar are switched off by default by the Logseq core. Press the ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/103b9a3f-8c25-4e42-903d-c05c71c349db) button on the toolbar to set it to be visible. The user can choose which buttons to display.
- Note: Except for the Undo/Redo button, the icons disappear when no page is open.

1. This plugin still has room for improvement. Please let me know if you encounter any issues or have any ideas for enhancement.
1. This plugin relies on Logseq's DOM (Document Object Model) structure. If the DOM structure changes due to a Logseq version update, styles may not be applied. We will adjust the CSS to deal with it. If you notice something, please raise an issue.
